# Simple Chatbot Project 

## Project Overview

This is a simple chatbot project designed to provide basic functionality, remember previous interactions, engage in user interaction through questions, and handle errors gracefully. The chatbot is implemented in Python and follows the specified project requirements.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

1. **`chatbot.py`**: The main Python script that contains the chatbot's functionality, including greeting, responding to questions, handling user input, remembering previous interactions, and asking questions.

2. **`README.md`**: This document provides an overview of the project, instructions on how to run the chatbot, and details about its functionality.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Basic Functionality:

- **Greeting Function:** The chatbot starts by greeting the user.
  
- **Responding to Questions:** The chatbot responds to at least five basic questions.
  
- **Farewell Message:** The chatbot includes a farewell message to conclude the conversation.

### 2. Previous Context:

- **Context Recall:** The chatbot can recall and reference the context of the conversation by displaying previous interactions when prompted.

### 3. User Interaction:

- **Asking Questions:** The chatbot engages in a flow where it asks the user at least three questions.

- **User Responses:** The chatbot reacts accordingly based on the user's responses, providing positive feedback for "yes" answers, encouraging responses for "no" answers, and handling other responses gracefully.

### 4. Error Handling:

- **Understanding User Input:** The chatbot implements basic error handling to address scenarios where it may not understand the user's input.

- **Friendly Responses:** In cases where the chatbot encounters an input it doesn't understand, it provides a friendly response to guide the conversation.
